When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working with other people, so that everyone involved has access to the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  So that you can decide when you make your commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  branches happen on a single repository; clones are duplicates of existing repositories; forks are clones made using github
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  So that you can go back and see the changes on other versions.  
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  I would collarborate without using github by simply working withthe other person/people in the same room at the same time using machines near to each other. This would make it easier to understand and/or implement changes in the program as you can ask them what they meant right away, However scheduling meet-ups may be too difficult and could end up delaying progress.
